    diagnostics(chains; kind = :bulk)

Effective sample size and split-R̂ of every coordinate, from one chain (a matrix with one
point per column) or several chains of equal length (a vector of such matrices), as
returned by [`sample`](@ref).

Returns a named tuple:

- `ess`, `rhat`: one value per coordinate, `NaN` for coordinates that are constant over
  every chain, such as fixed coordinates.
- `mean`, `std`: the mean and standard deviation of each coordinate over all chains.
- `mcse_mean`, `mcse_std`: their Monte Carlo standard errors, which account for the
  correlation between points; report estimates with these as error bars.
- `min_ess`, `max_rhat`: the smallest ESS and the largest R̂ over the varying coordinates.

`kind = :bulk` measures the center of each marginal and `kind = :tail` its 5% and 95%
quantiles (Vehtari et al. 2021). A common rule is to run until `max_rhat < 1.01` and
`min_ess` is at least 100 per chain. Computed with MCMCDiagnosticTools.jl.
