    HitAndRun()

Hit-and-run (Smith 1984): each step draws a direction uniformly from the unit sphere in the
coordinates of the warmup and moves to a uniform point on the chord of the polytope along
it. The chain is reversible, with the uniform distribution as its stationary distribution.
A step costs `O(mk)` for `m` constraints in `k` dimensions. For a [`Target`](@ref), the
point on the chord is drawn from the density along it by slice sampling.

    ACHR()

Artificial centering hit-and-run (Kaufman & Smith 1998), as in the COBRA Toolbox: each
direction runs from the running mean of the chain to a random extreme point of a
coordinate, so directions follow the shape of the polytope. The direction depends on the
history through the mean, so the chain is only approximately Markov, and its distribution
approaches uniform as the mean settles; on rounded polytopes it is the slowest method here.
It samples only the uniform distribution.

A warmup built with `extremes = false` (the default) solves the `2n` linear programs for
the extreme points when the first ACHR chain starts, and its chains share them.

    CoordinateHitAndRun(; moves = nothing, scan = :cyclic)

Coordinate hit-and-run: each move resamples one coordinate of the warmup uniformly on its
chord. On a rounded warmup this is CHRR (Haraldsdóttir et al. 2017), the default sampler of
the COBRA Toolbox. For a [`Target`](@ref), each move draws from the density along the chord
by slice sampling.

With `scan = :cyclic` (the default, as in hopsy) the coordinates are taken in turn; with
`scan = :random` each is chosen at random and the chain is reversible. Both keep the target
stationary; the cyclic scan gave 1.3 to 1.8 times the effective samples per move on the
polytopes of the test suite.

A move costs `O(m)` for `m` constraints, as the slacks are updated in place, and each step
of the chain makes `moves` moves (default: the dimension `k` of the warmup), so a step costs
about as much as one of [`HitAndRun`](@ref). Moves per effective sample grow as `k²`.

A chain started exactly at a vertex never moves when no coordinate axis points into the
polytope there, as on a simplex; [`sample`](@ref) and [`sample_until_converged`](@ref)
start chains inside the largest inscribed ball, away from vertices, unless given
`initial_params`.

Every chain starts at a uniform random point of the largest ball inside the polytope, so
the chains of an ensemble start apart, as R̂ in [`diagnostics`](@ref) assumes; pass
`initial_params`, a point of the polytope (a vector of points, one per chain, with an
ensemble), to choose the start. The chain then discards `discard_initial` steps and keeps
every `thinning`-th point. Consecutive points are correlated; check the effective sample
size with [`diagnostics`](@ref). Given a [`Polytope`](@ref), `sample` calls
[`warmup`](@ref) once for all chains with the given `extremes` and `rounding`. To run
chains until they converge, see [`sample_until_converged`](@ref).

With MCMCChains.jl loaded, `chain_type = Chains` returns an `MCMCChains.Chains` (one for all
chains of an ensemble), with parameters named `x[1]`, `x[2]`, … or by `param_names`, and the
statistics of each step (`AbstractMCMC.getstats`, such as `is_accept` or `n_reflections`) in
its `internals` section. `AbstractMCMC.steps` and callbacks receive each point as a transition
with fields `x` and `stats`.

This is `AbstractMCMC.sample` (also `StatsBase.sample`); its other keyword arguments, such
