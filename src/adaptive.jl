Run `nchains` chains, on the uniform distribution of a [`Warmup`](@ref) or the density of
a [`Target`](@ref), and double their length until the second half of the chains has a
smallest effective sample size of at least `target_ess` and a largest R̂ below `max_rhat`
over the varying coordinates; the first half is discarded as burn-in (Gelman & Rubin
1992). The first round keeps `n` points per chain; rounds stop once `max_n` points per
chain are kept.

Each chain starts at a random point of the largest ball inside the polytope and has its
own random number generator, seeded from `rng`, so the result does not depend on the
number of threads; chains run on separate threads when Julia has them.

Returns a named tuple: `chains` (one matrix per chain, a point per column), `diagnostics`
(see [`diagnostics`](@ref)), `n` (points kept per chain) and `converged`. A warning is
logged when the chains have not converged by `max_n`.

    mmcs([rng], P::Polytope; target_ess = 1000, optimizer = HiGHS.Optimizer, kwargs...)

Multiphase Monte Carlo sampling (Chalkis et al. 2021): prepare `P` with one linear program
and rounding from billiard-walk samples (`warmup(rng, P; extremes = false, rounding =
:samples)`), then run billiard-walk chains until they reach `target_ess` with R̂ below 1.01
([`sample_until_converged`](@ref), which takes the other keyword arguments).

Returns the named tuple of [`sample_until_converged`](@ref) with the `warmup` added.

This differs from the volesti implementation in its stopping rule: volesti sums the ESS of
single chains across phases, including the rounding phases, and restarts each window of
100 points near the center; here the rounding samples are discarded and several chains run
until R̂ also shows they agree.
