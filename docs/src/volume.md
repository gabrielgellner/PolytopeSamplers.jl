# Volume

[`volume`](@ref) estimates the volume of a polytope with a standard error. For a polytope
with equalities it gives the volume of the slice the polytope lies on, in that slice's own
dimension: the simplex `x ≥ 0, Σx = 1` in 3 variables has area `√3 / 2`.

```@example volume
using PolytopeSamplers, Random

P = Polytope(zeros(3), ones(3); C = ones(1, 3), d = [1.0])
v = volume(Xoshiro(1), P)
v.volume, v.log_stderr, sqrt(3) / 2
```

`log_stderr` is the standard error of `log_volume`, close to the relative standard error of
`volume`. Volumes in high dimensions under- or overflow, so work with `log_volume`:

```@example volume
cube = Polytope(zeros(50), fill(2.0, 50))
v = volume(Xoshiro(2), cube; error = 0.05)
v.log_volume, v.log_stderr, 50 * log(2)
```

## Method

The estimate multiplies volume ratios (multiphase Monte Carlo with cooling balls, Chalkis,
Emiris & Fisikopoulos 2023). In the rounded coordinates of the warmup, balls centered at the
warmup center shrink from one holding the polytope to one of which 10–15% lies inside it.
Each body `K ∩ B(ρᵢ₊₁)` holds about an eighth of `K ∩ B(ρᵢ)`, so a 63-dimensional food web
polytope needs about 10 phases.

- The share of the last ball inside the polytope comes from independent uniform points of
  the ball.
- Each ratio `vol(K ∩ B(ρᵢ₊₁)) / vol(K ∩ B(ρᵢ))` comes from coordinate hit-and-run chains
  on `K ∩ B(ρᵢ)`, doubled until R̂ is below 1.01 and the ratio's Monte Carlo standard
  error meets its share of `error`.

The phases are independent, so the variance of the log volume is the sum of the squared
relative standard errors of the ratios.

## Calibration

Over 50 seeds on a 40-dimensional cube, a 20-dimensional simplex, an 8-dimensional
cross-polytope and a 14-dimensional simplex slice, the z-scores of the log volume had root
mean square between 0.90 and 1.13, and 46 to 50 of the 50 estimates were within two standard
errors. The mean z-score was between 0.0 and 0.27: the logarithm of a ratio estimate is
biased by about half its squared relative error, small next to the standard error.

## Food webs

For [constrained food webs](@ref "Example: constrained food webs") with fixed growth rates,
the volume of the polytope of interaction strengths measures how many communities share the
equilibrium. Under a uniform prior on the growth rates and interaction strengths jointly,
each growth-rate vector is weighted by this volume.
