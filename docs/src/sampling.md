# Sampling and convergence

## `sample`

[`sample`](@ref) implements the [AbstractMCMC](https://github.com/TuringLang/AbstractMCMC.jl)
interface. It takes a model (a [`Warmup`](@ref) for the uniform distribution, or a
[`Target`](@ref) for a density), a sampler and a number of points, and returns one point
per column:

```@example sampling
using PolytopeSamplers, Random

P = Polytope([0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]; A = [1.0 1.0], b = [1.0])
w = warmup(P)
X = sample(Xoshiro(1), w, BilliardWalk(), 1_000; discard_initial = 100, progress = false)
size(X)
```

- `discard_initial` drops the first steps, and `thinning` keeps every `thinning`-th point.
- Several chains run with `MCMCThreads()`, `MCMCSerial()` or `MCMCDistributed()` and come
  back as a vector of matrices.
- Passing a [`Polytope`](@ref) instead of a warmup calls `warmup` once for all chains.

```@example sampling
chains = sample(Xoshiro(1), w, BilliardWalk(), MCMCThreads(), 1_000, 4; progress = false)
length(chains), size(first(chains))
```

With [MCMCChains](https://github.com/TuringLang/MCMCChains.jl) loaded, `chain_type =
Chains` returns the chains as one `Chains` object, for its summaries, its plots with
StatsPlots and its conversion to ArviZ. Name the coordinates with `param_names`:

```@example sampling
using MCMCChains

c = sample(
    Xoshiro(1), w, BilliardWalk(), MCMCThreads(), 1_000, 4;
    chain_type = Chains, param_names = ["x₁", "x₂"], progress = false,
)
summarystats(c)
```

The `internals` section holds the statistics of each step, from `AbstractMCMC.getstats`:

| Sampler | Statistics |
|---|---|
| [`BilliardWalk`](@ref) | `n_reflections`, the reflections in the step |
| [`DikinWalk`](@ref), [`VaidyaWalk`](@ref) | `is_accept`, and `acceptance_rate` so far |
| [`CRHMC`](@ref) | `is_accept`, `acceptance_rate` and `step_size` |
| [`HitAndRun`](@ref), [`CoordinateHitAndRun`](@ref) with a [`Target`](@ref) | `n_evaluations`, the log-density evaluations of the slice sampler |

With a [`Target`](@ref), every sampler also reports `lp`, the log density at the point.
The uniform hit-and-run methods report none.

```@example sampling
summarystats(c; sections = :internals)
```

## Diagnostics

Consecutive points of a chain are correlated, so `n` points carry less information than
`n` independent draws. [`diagnostics`](@ref) measures this for every coordinate:

```@example sampling
d = diagnostics(chains)
(; d.min_ess, d.max_rhat)
```

- `ess`: the effective sample size, the number of independent draws the chain is worth.
- `rhat`: the rank split-R̂ (Vehtari et al. 2021), which compares the chains with each
  other and with themselves, in location and in spread; values above 1.01 mean the chains
  have not converged.
- `mean`, `std` and their Monte Carlo standard errors `mcse_mean`, `mcse_std`: report
  estimates with these as error bars.

R̂ needs several chains that start in different places. [`sample`](@ref) starts each chain
at a uniform random point of the largest ball inside the polytope, or at the point given by
`initial_params` (one per chain with an ensemble). A single chain can look converged while
it has explored only part of the polytope, so run at least four.

## Sampling until converged

[`sample_until_converged`](@ref) automates the usual protocol: run several chains, discard
the first half as burn-in, and double the length until the targets are met.

```@example sampling
r = sample_until_converged(Xoshiro(2), w, CoordinateHitAndRun(); target_ess = 2_000)
(; r.converged, r.n, r.diagnostics.min_ess, r.diagnostics.max_rhat)
```

Chains start at random points inside the largest ball in the polytope, each with its own
random number generator seeded from `rng`, so the result does not depend on the number of
threads. When the chains have not converged by `max_n` points, `converged` is `false` and
a warning is logged.

[`mmcs`](@ref) runs multiphase Monte Carlo sampling: a one-program warmup with rounding from
samples, then billiard-walk chains until convergence.

## What R̂ catches

R̂ is the check against chains that have not mixed. In the stress tests, chains started near
the corners of a 49-dimensional simplex had R̂ above 1.05 after 100 steps for every method,
and every run that reached R̂ below 1.01 had means and standard deviations within their
standard errors of the exact values. A run that stops at `max_n` with R̂ above 1.01 should
not be used.
